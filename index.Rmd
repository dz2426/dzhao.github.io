# About me

I am a first-year master student studying M.S Biostatistics at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My current track is in Statistical Genetics. What brings me to this wonderful department is probably my passion in developing deeper understandings of neurological diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's) and providing reasonable therapeutic plans.

_Fun Fact: I used to be a keyboard player of a pop rock band during my undergraduate study. The band is called 'Hermit'._
