This site is made by Rmarkdown and github pages. It is hosted by my github account, linked at the top right corner. 

This site is for introducing myself as a current M.S Biostatistics student in Columbia University. It includes my updated profiles and contains a list of data science projects and statistical analyses throughout my graduate study.
